% function allAcc = LRSearchLambdaSGD(Xtrain, Ytrain, Xvalidation, Yvalidation, lambdas)
% For each value of lambda provided, fit parameters to the training data and return
% the accuracy in the validation data in the corresponding entry of allAcc.
% For instance, allAcc(i) = accuracy in the validation set using lambdas(i).
%
% Inputs:
% Xtrain        training data features   (numTrainInstances x numFeatures)
% Ytrain        training set labels      (numTrainInstances x 1)
% Xvalidation   validation data features (numValidInstances x num features)
% Yvalidation   validation set labels    (numValidInstances x 1)
% lambdas       values of lambda to try  (numLambdas x 1)
%
% Output:
% allAcc        vector of accuracies in validation set  (numLambdas x 1)
