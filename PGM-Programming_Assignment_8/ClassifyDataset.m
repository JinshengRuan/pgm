function accuracy = ClassifyDataset(dataset, labels, P, G)
% returns the accuracy of the model P and graph G on the dataset 
%
% Inputs:
% dataset: N x 10 x 3, N test instances represented by 10 parts
% labels:  N x 2 true class labels for the instances.
%          labels(i,j)=1 if the ith instance belongs to class j 
% P: struct array model parameters (explained in PA description)
% G: graph structure and parameterization (explained in PA description) 
%
% Outputs:
% accuracy: fraction of correctly classified instances (scalar)
