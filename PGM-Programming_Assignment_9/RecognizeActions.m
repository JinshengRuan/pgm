function [accuracy, predicted_labels] = RecognizeActions(datasetTrain, datasetTest, G, maxIter)

% INPUTS
% datasetTrain: dataset for training models, see PA for details
% datasetTest: dataset for testing models, see PA for details
% G: graph parameterization as explained in PA decription
% maxIter: max number of iterations to run for EM

% OUTPUTS
% accuracy: recognition accuracy, defined as (#correctly classified examples / #total examples)
% predicted_labels: N x 1 vector with the predicted labels for each of the instances in datasetTest, with N being the number of unknown test instances


% Train a model for each action
% Note that all actions share the same graph parameterization and number of max iterations
